    <h1>Escanor - The Lion's Sin of Pride</h1>

    <p>
        Escanor is one of the most powerful characters in the anime and manga series 
        <em>Nanatsu no Taizai</em> (The Seven Deadly Sins). Known as the Lion's Sin of Pride, 
        his strength increases during the day and reaches its peak at noon. Despite his prideful 
        nature during the day, he is humble and gentle at night. Escanor's personality and 
        incredible abilities make him a fan-favorite character.
